## Defense Department Form 254

### Contract Security Classification Specification

The DD254 is a standard form attached to contracts covering classified information.  It indicates the types of classification of data a contractor is eligible to recieve / process / work with in the performance of their contract (and so, governs the personnel and facilities clearance types that can be utilized or issued in association with that work).

DD254's are unfortunately usually filled out in a Acrobat-only javascript infested nightmare of a PDF.  If you're using anything other than Acrobat reader, it probably won't work.
