## Getting a JPAS account

Beyond a need to know, etc., you must have the following to complete the form for a JPAS account:

1. [JCAVS Training certificate of completion]({{< relref "#jcavs-training" >}})
2. DOD Cyber Challenge certificate completion
3. DOD PII Handling certificate completion
4. Letter of Appointment
5. PSSAR

### JCAVS Training

In order to take this training and get the appropriate certificate, you must first register with [STEPP](https://cdse.usalearning.gov/login/create_account.php).  
{{% notice tip %}}
[STEPP](/glossary/#stepp) is the online training system DSS uses, and an account is important for many of the requirements.

For a non-SCI, non-possessing FSO, you must successfully pass the JCAVS User Level 2-6 (PS183.06) exam completion.  
The training for this exam is [JCAVS User Levels 2-6 Course](https://www.cdse.edu/catalog/elearning/PS183.html).  
The exam itself is focused mainly on the content and sections of the screens, and does not match the course very well.
