## What is JPAS? JCAVS? 

JCAVS and JPAS are different names for the same thing basically.

## Getting a JPAS account

Beyond a need to know, etc., you must have the following to complete the form for a JPAS account:

1. [DOD Cyber Challenge certificate completion]({{< relref "#dod-cyber-awareness-challenge" >}})
1. [DOD PII Handling certificate completion]({{< relref "#pii" >}})
1. [JCAVS Training certificate of completion]({{< relref "#jcavs-training" >}})
1. [Letter of Appointment]({{< relref "#letter-of-appointment" >}})
1. [PSSAR]({{< relref "#pssar" >}})
1. [PKI Certificate]({{< relref "#pki-certificate" >}})

{{% notice tip %}}
The first 2 are public, and require no registration or signup - just click through and spend an hour or so with the training and pass the exam.  Both offer unlimited retries.

### DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge

You must complete the [DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge](https://public.cyber.mil/training/cyber-awareness-challenge-2019/).  Note that this URL changes regularly, and to visit the [Cyber.mil](https://public.cyber.mil) site for a link to the latest (it's usually on the front page).
{{% notice tip %}}
If you've taken this before (required annually for most people), the new version lets you basically just take the exam parts, and only makes you sit through the training for what you get wrong, so, do that and save a ton of time (nearly an hour if you get them all right).

### PII

You must have a certificate of completion from less than 1 year ago for the [Identifying and Safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://public.cyber.mil/training/identifying-and-safeguarding-personally-identifiable-information-pii/).

### JCAVS Training

In order to take this training and get the appropriate certificate, you must first register with [STEPP](https://cdse.usalearning.gov/login/create_account.php).  
{{% notice tip %}}
[STEPP](/glossary/#stepp) is the online training system DSS uses, and an account is important for many of the requirements.

For a non-SCI, non-possessing FSO, you must successfully pass the JCAVS User Level 2-6 (PS183.06) exam completion.  
The training for this exam is [JCAVS User Levels 2-6 Course](https://www.cdse.edu/catalog/elearning/PS183.html).  
The exam itself is focused mainly on the content and sections of the screens, and does not match the course very well.  

### Letter of Appointment

A letter, on company letter head, signed by KMP appointing you to the appropriate role in JPAS.  If you're the KMP and the FSO, congratulations, you write yourself an appointment letter.

### PSSAR

A PDF that has to be filled out and sent via encrypted email.

### PKI Certificate 

CAC or ECA.
